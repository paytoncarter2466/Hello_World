	My name is Payton Carter. I'm a 20 year old living in Corvallis and working at Dairy Queen when I'm not attending classes here. There isn't any really deep backstory as to why I'm in this class. I've just always been interested in computers and interested in learning more about them(which worked out because programming is pretty fun). What I want from this class is exactly what's advertised. My goal is to get better at programming. I've been writing little games and stuff in Python but there's only so much you can do with the really basic commands and no graphics. I also want to become more employable if I can help it.
